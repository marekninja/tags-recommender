The U.S. media is\\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\\natrocities.\\n\\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\\ngo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races\\nwhen they got power. It is unfortunate.\\n\""

       " \"\\nI am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\n",
       " 'From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46\\n\\n\\tThe Problem Book of Anania of Shirak\\n\\t------------------------------------\\n\\n\\t\\t\"On the ancient peak of Ararat\\n\\t\\tThe centuries have come like seconds\\n\\t\\tAnd passed on.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-Avetik Issahakian\\n\\nby Yuri Danilov\\n\\nSome years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \"What\\nbooks would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\" And \\nthough the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, \\ndepending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, \\nand celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, \\nnot one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at\\nleast one book of arithmetic problems.\\n\\nSome of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they \\nwere trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \"numbers\" (though \\nsecretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty \\n\\tof this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, \\n\\twill work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--V. Bonch-Bruyevich introduction to the\\n\\t\\t\\tRussian translation of Solid-Body\\n\\t\\t\\tSymmetry by R. Knox and A. Gold\\n\\nLet\\'s imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high \\nschoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman \\ncrater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take \\nthis very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read \\nthis article and say to himself: \"This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty \\ninteresting guy. When I get home I\\'ll try to find his problems.\"\\n\\nGood luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then\\nthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And \\nwe can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by \\nIosef Orbeli.\\n\\n[1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian.

       " \"\\n\\n\\nIMHO = in my humble opinion!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI didn't say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusing\\nto newbies. \\n\\n\\nBill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears.

I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him\\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \\nright! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since\\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\\nthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\\nor better as a result, is absurd.\\n\\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to\\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\\nAnd that was my original point.\"]"

And no Muslim country was doing\\nmuch of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi\\nArabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating\\nin favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),\\njust because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively\\nrich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.\\n\\nSo how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled\\nback the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???\\n\\n\\nI think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an\\nofficial religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature\\nlike it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the\\nones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this\\nworld (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a \\nleader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.\\n\\n\\nYou make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your\\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\\nFriday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is\\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\\n\\n\\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\\n\\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\\n\\t  brings the death penalty.  \\n\\n\\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\\n\\n\\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\\n\\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\\n\\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\\n\\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\\n\\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\\n\\t  prostitutes.\\n\\n\\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\\n\\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\\n\\t  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\\n\\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\\n\\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \\n\\n\\t  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\\n\\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\\n\\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\\n\\n\\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\\n\\n\\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\\n\\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that\\nthey've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious\\ngatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers\\noffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who\\ndare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the\\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small\\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\\nSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.\\n\\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\\nwant, Ilyess?\\n\",\n",

It\\'s okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\\nElisabeth, I\\'m going to quote from Zinsser\\'s Microbiology, 20th Edition.\\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \\ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \\nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \\nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \\nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \\ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \\n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \\nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \\nit.\\n\\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \\ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\\'s again: \"However, some factors, such as \\nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \\nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \\nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \\nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \\n\\n\\n\\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \\nnoticed my faculty rank, I\\'m a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser\\'s).  But, as you point \\nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \\npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \\nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it\\'s a lot of \\nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\\n\\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven\\'t been able to figure out why such a small \\nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \\nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \\nI\\'ve said, that it will make sense.

This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical.

Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.',\n",

Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.

Just a simple question.\\n\\n...with a simple answer!\\n\\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \\nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \\n\\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\\n\\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \\nsociety.\\n\\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak\\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \\n[EE] consciousness.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \\nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \\nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \\npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \\nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \\n\\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\\n\\nYou answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry\\nwas the word Armenian!\\n\\n[EE] Regards,\\n\\n\",\n",

The\\nonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if\\nhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been\\nquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the\\nDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,\\nand he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder\\nwhether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those\\ninjuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an\\nearthquake collapsed the root cellar.\\n\\n\\nLet's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly\\nKisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong\\nobjections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do\\nwith both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.\\n\\nImagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine\\nhadn't jammed.\\n\\n\\nEspecially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it.

Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged\\n   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at\\n   Albany Congress: \"It would be a strange thing...if six nations\\n   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union\\n   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted\\n   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should\\n   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.\"\\n      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs\\n   and congressional delegates in order to \"hammer out a plan that he\\n   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.\"\\n\\nGrinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California\\nat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the\\nAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.',\n",

Because Shea Stadium was tied into\\nthe World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to\\npromote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing\\nwith the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.\\n\\n\\nI'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a\\nregular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and\\nrenovated the place.  Remember, this is its 30th Year!\",\n",

       " ('\\n\\nDiplomatic :-)\\n\\nI realize I\\'m fighting Occam\\'s razor in this argument, so I\\'ll try to\\nexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. \\n\\nFirstly, I\\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.',\n",

If\\nsociety can have its cement plant without violating anyone\\'s rights,\\nfine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less\\ncement plant.  (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-)\\n\\n\\n\"One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with,\\nin order to minimize the transactions costs.\"???  Which \"one\" are you\\nspeaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people\\'s rights.\\nBesides, Coase\\'s Theorem only has real application in the never-never\\nland of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people\\nare going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise \"irrational\"\\nfrom a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to\\nprotect their right to be so.  I don\\'t care if you can show me logically\\nthat your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,\\nso I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150\\nper head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don\\'t\\nwant any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.\\n\\n*   *   *   *   *\\n\\n\\nLast question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because\\nto do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth\\nAmendment.\\n\\nAs to your \"Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made\\nwhole, because the award of damages in involuntary\" claim, you\\'re at\\nleast partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has\\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\\n\\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\\npotential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he\\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\\nparties themselves.\\n\\n\\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they\\'re simply a cost of doing business.  The\\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\\nproperty rights they\\'d be violating via the operation of their plant.\\nThere\\'s nothing punitive or unjust about it.\\n\\n\\nAnybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be\\nrequired to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the\\nseller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No\\ninjustice, no punitive damages.\\n\\n*   *   *   *   *\\n\\n\\nDoesn\\'t sound very much like a libertarian to me.  Libertarians tend to\\nbelieve in the rights of individual people, not societies.\\n\\n*   *   *   *   *\\n\\n\\nAs stated above, the tort was _ongoing_.  Atlantic Cement wanted to be\\nable to _continue_ to violate Boomer\\'s rights.  While the court may have\\nbeen justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already\\ncommitted, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the\\n_future_ violations of Boomer\\'s rights and to then force Boomer to sell\\nat that price.',\n",

(What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to\\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\\n    pixels.\\n\\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\\n    If\\tyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\\n    swap all short and long integer values.\\n\\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension \".BMP\".   This  is  because\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 2 -\\n\\n\\n    they  are  a  super-set of earlier \"bitmap image files\".  Consequently you\\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files.\\n\\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three \"flavors\"  of  DIB\\n    images:\\n\\t o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended\\t convention,  and  the\\n\\t     form  which I will describe how to create.\\t They are intended for\\n\\t     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\\n\\t o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the\\tflavor\\n\\t     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\\n\\t o   Old-style Bitmap images.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 3 -\\n\\n\\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\\n\\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\t as  a\\n\\t     DIB  file.\\t  This\\theader\\talso gives the total size of the image\\n\\t     file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.  A \"BITMAPINFOHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,\\n\\t     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\\n\\t     RGBQUAD structure.\\n\\t 4.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  The same \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\n\\t     as\\t a  DIB\\t file.\\t This  header also gives the total size of the\\n\\t     image file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.  A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this\\n\\t     exists  it\\t may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a\\n\\t     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.\\n\\t 4.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:\\n\\t 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.\\t Which\\theader\\n\\t     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.\\n\\t 2.  An optional color palette.\\t  This\\tpalette\\t may  be  composed  of\\n\\t     either   Windows\\tRGBQUAD\\t  structures  (if  the\\theader\\twas  a\\n\\t     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the\\theader\\n\\t     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).\\n\\t 3.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.\\n\\n    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward\\tsteps.\\n    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header\\n    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  \"windows.h\"\\tinclude\\t file.\\n    Palette  information  needs\\t to  be\\t stored for images that are not 24-bit\\n    images.  The five general steps are:\\n\\t 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER\\t  and\\tthe   BITMAPINFOHEADER\\n\\t     structures the basic image information.\\n\\t 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,\\t creating  the\\n\\t     color palette of RGBQUADS.\\n\\t 3.

On an intel byte ordered\\n    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed\\tin  C  as  the\\n    quantity (\\'M\\' << 8 | \\'B\\') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.\\n\\n    The \"bfSize\" field is the total size of the file.  For our\\tpurposes  this\\n    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the\\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the\\t color\\tpalette\\t times\\n    the\\t size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.\\tIf the\\n    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be\\n    calculated\\tahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in\\n    later.\\n\\n    Both the \"bfReserved1\" and the \"bfReserved2\"  fields  are  always  set  to\\n    zero.\\n\\n    The \"bfOffBits\" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data\\n    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set\\n    to:\\t the  size  of\\tthe   BITMAPFILEHEADER,\\t  plus\\t the   size   of   the\\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times\\n    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written\\n    write after the color palette if one exists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 6 -\\n\\n\\n    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER\\n\\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biSize;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biWidth;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biHeight;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t biPlanes;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t biBitCount;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biCompression;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biSizeImage;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biXPelsPerMeter;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biYPelsPerMeter;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biClrUsed;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biClrImportant;\\n\\t } BITMAPINFOHEADER;\\n\\n    The \"biSize\" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure\\n    itself.   When  reading  the  image\\t file,\\tthis  value is what is used to\\n    determine  that  the  image\\t contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER\\t and   not   a\\n    BITMAPCOREHEADER.\\n\\n    The \"biWidth\" field is the width of the image in image pixels.\\n\\n    The \"biHeight\" field is the height of the image in image lines.\\n\\n    The \"biPlanes\" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out\\n    as if there was one color plane.\\n\\n    The \"biBitCount\" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either\\n    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.\\n\\n    The \"biCompression\" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is\\n    compressed.\\t   DIB\\timages\\tsupport\\t two  forms  of\\t run-length  encoding.\\n    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don\\'t know yet how\\n    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the\\n    data is not compressed.\\n\\n    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to\\n    zero.   A  requirement  of\\tthe  interpretting software that it be able to\\n    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.\\n\\n    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be \"biClrUsed\".\\n    For\\t 4-bit\\tand  8-bit  images  this  field\\t indicates that not all of the\\n    possible color entries are used and that the  image\\t contains  \"biClrUsed\"\\n    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may\\n    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set\\n    this field to zero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 7 -\\n\\n\\n    COLOR PALETTES\\n\\n    Each entry of a  color  palette  is\\t a  RGBQUAD  structure.\\t  The  RGBQUAD\\n    structure is defined in the \"windows.h\" include file as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbBlue;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbGreen;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbRed;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbReserved;\\n\\t } RGBQUAD;\\n    The \"rgbReserved\" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the\\tamount\\n    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is\\n    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  \"rgbBlue\",  \"rgbGreen\",  or\\n    \"rgbRed\"   fields  indicates  that\\tthat  particular  component  does  not\\n    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in\\tany  of\\t these\\n    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully\\t to  the color\\n    composition.\\n\\n\\n\\n    IMAGE DATA\\n\\n    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data\\tin  DIB\\t image\\n    file.   The\\t creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and\\n    certainly was.\\n\\n    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four\\n    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\t---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\\n    The\\t bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\\n    first line of image data in the file.\\n\\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written\\tas  you\\t would\\n    expect.   One  bit\\timages\\tare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be\\t written  out  in  the\\n    order  blue,  green, red.

A\\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\\n\\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \\ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\\n\\nSo...

       " ('From article <1r0mhtINNa59@cronkite.Central.Sun.COM>, by dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM (Dave Bernard):\\n\\nI noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\\nDavid Koresh had \"explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\\nfeet into the air.\"  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren\\'t living in a\\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn\\'t\\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn\\'t have any explosives or\\nsimilar munitions?  I just don\\'t buy what the ATF and FBI have been\\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\\n\\nHere\\'s something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\\ndon\\'t think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn\\'t due to something like TNT,\\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\\n\\nIsn\\'t it curious that the ATF wasn\\'t very forthcoming about how the four\\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN\\'T READY TO RELEASE\\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\\n\\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\\nbody during one of the lawyer\\'s visits to the compound.  Later on\\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don\\'t know if it was a dud or a\\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn\\'t it be\\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won\\'t investigate until the\\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\\nyou know what I mean.  I\\'m probably being a little paranoid here\\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\\nused grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.\\n\\n\\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot',\n",

       " (\"News:\\n=====\\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n',\n",

First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.',\n",

I guess I\\'ll study\\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \\ngive me will be appreciated.\\n\\n    -------------------------------------------\\n\\n[I don\\'t think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\\ndifferent tradition than yours.\\n\\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\\nSince this isn\\'t in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\\nunderstand in this way if they didn\\'t already believe it), Protestants\\ndon\\'t accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\\n\\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it\\'s a matter\\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\\nwho don\\'t.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I\\'d \\nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\\n\\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between\\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\\n  Church of Christ\\n\\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\\nquite marked.\\n\\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\\ngive a feeling for their nature.

And that is especially bizarre in that\\nChristian prayer DOESN\\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \\nbeing able taking note of it.)\\n\\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\\n\"mainstream\" religion.\\n\\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\\ndoesn\\'t NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\\nforms.

I can only hope that the political\\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\\non non-Christians.\\n\\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.

I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?

       " ('Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space\\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\nfor future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\\n   It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t\\nthat there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\nthe near term.

Med.\\nI didn\\'t know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \\nlike I haven\\'t read \"The Yeast Connection\").\\n\\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \\nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \\nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I\\'m still not sure that if a \\nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \\nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\\n\\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \\ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \\ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\\nBut some things I just can\\'t buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \\noxidative damage in the body).\\n\\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \\nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \\nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \\nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \\ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \\nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \\ncouldn\\'t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I\\'m really \\nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \\nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \\nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \\nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \\n\\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \\nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \\nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \\nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \\nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\\n\\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I\\'ve seen speculation \\nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \\nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \\nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \\nseparate the fiction from the fact.\\n\\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \\nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What\\'s it doing \\nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \\nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \\nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\\n\\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \\ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \\nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \\nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \\nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \\nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \\npart of the ageing process in humans).\\n\\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \\ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \\nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \\nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \\ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \\nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \\ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \\nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \\nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \\ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \\nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \\ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\\n\\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \\nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \\na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \\nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don\\'t know any \\nbetter).\\n\\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \\nI\\'m inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \\nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \\nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I\\'m \\ngoing to give isn\\'t going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \\nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I\\'ll have to live with that label.\\n\\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert\\'s \\ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \\nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can\\'t remember the network or his \\nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \\nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \\nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \\ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \\ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \\ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \\nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \\nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?

California schools reported a 200% increase in\\nstudent gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between\\n1988 and 1990.

       " ('\\nDo not presume to tell me what I have and have not read.  The system may\\nnot rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but\\nit is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some\\nsuspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys\\nfrom escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal\\'s\\ncoercing or colluding use of some other person\\'s Clipper phone.\\n\\nI will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\\nThe original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal\\nand illegal cipher systems considered harmful\", but \"Clipper considered\\nharmful\" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\\n\\nAssumptions:\\n\\n  1.  Clipper is made available.\\n\\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\\n      detection a cause for further action.\\n\\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\\n      some association between the common carrier\\'s unique phone ID (ESN) and\\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\\n      red flag.\\n\\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\\n      and much less spoofable than today\\'s cellphones.\\n\\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\\n      each one has a unique unit key.\\n\\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\\n      immediate suspicion.\\n\\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\\n\\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one\\'s\\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\\nassociated with someone else.\\n\\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\\nor steal use of someone\\'s phone in a way that prevents that person from\\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\\n\\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn\\'t want to pay someone\\nelse\\'s bill, and he doesn\\'t want to fall under suspicion.\\n\\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\\nand collusion.\\n\\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\\nfreshly coerced phones.\\n\\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don\\'t-care patsies who need money,\\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\\nphone service for someone else\\'s use.\\n\\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone\\'s use being coerced must\\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\\n\\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\\n\\nWhereas a criminal\\'s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\\nwould stand out, a criminal\\'s use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\\nchip is fractured.\\n\\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he\\'ll be\\nusing someone else\\'s phone), but you\\'ll have no evidence to help you against\\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\\n\\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\\nthey were before Clipper came along.\\n\\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\\n\\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\\n\\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\\n\\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\\n\\n  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\\n      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\\n      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\\n      escrow is claimed to help against.\\n\\n  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\\n      of \"illegal\" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher\\n      machine...',\n",

Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God!

If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith.

       " ('[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\\n\\nR. Scroggs\\n\\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  ',\n",

Thus, one can edit text that\\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\\n\\nAUIS has three components:\\n\\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\\n    available types of objects. \\n\\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\\n    easily as those that come with the system. \\n\\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.

European policy is based on cultural and\\n   religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it\\'s fair to say\\n   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims\\n   were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression\\n   instead of Serbian aggression.\\n\\nToo bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which \\npointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger\\nwithin the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin\\nto predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:\\n\\n   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear\\n   this is a big deal... so they will understand.\\n\\nand it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of\\nself-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have \\naided the Serbian aggression.

Under such\\nconditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a \"divide-and-conquer\"\\ngame, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common\\ninterests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) \\nto start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.\\n\\nOne final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has\\nsaid in Rome last week that \"In practice, the embargo had the opposite\\neffect intended.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  \\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \\nstandoff ensued.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \\ninsane.      \\n\\n\\t     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \\nagents against the compound.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  \\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \\nimplementation of the decision.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  \\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \\ndone differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \\ncircumstances.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \\nhas been learned now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \\nwith --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I was further told that under no circumstances would our \\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  \\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \\nI was given were the following:\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \\nmembers to come out.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number three, that the danger of their doing something \\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \\nthe passage of time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And number four, that they had reason to believe that \\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused \\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  \\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third question I asked was, has the military been \\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \\nsignificance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \\nto unfold.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  \\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \\nchildren.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \\ndecide that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have \\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \\nevidence we have.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, were there any other options \\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \\njust began to spin downward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with \\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  \\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the government know that the children did not \\nhave gas masks?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \\ncountry.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Go ahead, Sarah.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The \\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not \\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance \\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was \\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived \\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't \\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their \\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had \\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What federal laws --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't \\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the \\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they \\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but \\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of \\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of \\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were \\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that \\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have \\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground \\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be \\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if \\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane \\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace \\nwhere they could be protected.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned \\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas \\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks \\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they \\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a \\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked \\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you \\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your \\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had \\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the \\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that \\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues \\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would \\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in \\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were \\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the \\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate \\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were \\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  \\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a \\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't \\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't \\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I \\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I \\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to \\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had \\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, \\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. \\nAnd I do support her.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     She is not ultimately responsible to the American \\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an \\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as \\nwell as she could have.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.  (Applause.)\",\n",

       " ('-*----\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.

Is it prophetic?\\n3. Is it authentic?\\n4. Is it dynamic?\\n5. Is it received, collected, read and used?\\n\\nOn these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\\nTo quote Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\\n1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\\nanachronisms.\\n2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\nwhich are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\nsubject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\nScripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\npoetic and religious feeling.\\n\\n\\nBut the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that\\nthe Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and\\nit wasn\\'t until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw\\nthem out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn\\'t\\naccept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical\\nprecedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the\\napocrapha under protest, and it was literally \\'over his dead\\nbody\\' that it was included in the catholic canon.\\n\\n\\nHow do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\\nwords of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\\nthem, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\nAnd if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\\ntake away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\\nholy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\\nSurely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\\n\\nIt is also noteworthy to consider Jesus\\' attitude. He had no\\nargument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\\n10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \\nthat in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \\nOT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\\ntaking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\\nGenesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\\n\\n\\nI am not familiar with the book. \\nSome other arguments you might like to consider are found in\\nChapter 3 of Josh McDowell\\'s Evidence That Demands A Verdict.',\n",

This\\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\\n\\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\\nwon in their building, we\\'re going to win in ours\".\\n\\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series.

Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between\\nArmenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics\\nled him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a \\ndistinct race.\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.

In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.

His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\\n\\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\\namong the Greeks.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\\n\\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God\\'s word to the Jews in\\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\\ncourse, Anglicans don\\'t do so :-)).

The following are quotes of his speech: \\n\\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \\nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq\\'s \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait\\'s name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe \\'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of \\'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for \\'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr\\'s chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of \\'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.\\'\\' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.\\'\\' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather\\'s agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa\\'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.\\'\\' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,\\'\\' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.\\'\\' \\nThis description of Pelly\\'s reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \\nCazee\\'s decision.\\'\\' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \\nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \\narmy.\\'\\' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \\ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \\n\\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \\nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \\nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them.

Hold to my policy, and \\nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \\nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.\\'\\' \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,\\'\\' but \\nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \\nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait\\'s position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\n\\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\\n\\n\\t\"\\'I am free to do anything,\\' you say.  Yes, but not everything\\n\\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\\n\\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\\n\\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\nyou can think of to do so.\\n\\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\nWHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\ncondemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\\n\\nWhy, for God\\'s sake?\\n\\n\\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\\n\\tto condemn the world,\\n\\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\\n\\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\\n\\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\\n\\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God\\'s only Son.\\n\\tNow the judgment is this:\\n\\tthe light has come into the world,\\n\\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\\n\\tbecause their deeds were evil.\\n\\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\\n\\thates the light,\\n\\tand does not come near the light\\n\\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\\n\\tBut he who acts in truth\\n\\tcomes into the light,\\n\\tso that it may be sh0own\\n\\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\\tJohn 3:17-21\\n\\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\\nrejected.

McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\\n\\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\\n  son...

(Joel 2:32)\\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\\n\\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\\n  22:12)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\\n\\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\\n\\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\\n  Moses, Moses.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\\n\\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah\\'s\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\\n5:27)\\n\\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\\nBible reveals that \"Elohim\\'s\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16.

(Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\\n\\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\\n\\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\\n\\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\\n  (Josh. 23:7)\\n\\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\\n\\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\\n\\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\\n\\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\\n\\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\\n\\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\\n17:3)',\n",

       " ('\\nThere are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very\\nwide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.\\nNo private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ...\\nand as our private sector has discovered, they\\'re better off not\\noffering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.\\n(-;\\n\\n\\nThe alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,\\ndoctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you\\ncan\\'t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they\\nwill not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered\\nby private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.\\nAgain, they can\\'t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.\\n\\nPlus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I\\'m basically\\nanti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can\\'t\\nbring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I\\nunderstand where you\\'re coming from.  Up north, you\\'re so much more\\nlikely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health\\ninsurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...\\n\\n\\nYes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.  Sorry, I musta lost you in\\nthat verbose blurb ...\\n\\n\\nIn Canada and Germany, it\\'s not mandatory.  However, it is negative\\noption in that you must request the exemption.  That the private\\nsector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option\\n(as in the Quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...\\n\\n\\nYes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are\\ntoo small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so\\nyou pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get\\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.  That we have a CMA doctors\\nmonopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby\\nNEVER tells you down here ...\\n\\n\\nNo, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends\\nare (-;) but there\\'s the question of our small market dynamics up\\nnorth ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell\\ntheir services to Americans to generate more business will inflate\\ntheir effective population served, and thus make some specialties\\nfinally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do\\nnot have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.\\n\\n\\nUh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness\\nfunds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they\\'re\\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who\\'ll sell extra\\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\\n\\nRemember, the Germans don\\'t have HMO\\'s ... a telling sign, \\'cos\\nRochester does and they\\'re also a company town.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but\\nI\\'ve come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about\\nour \"system\".  If much or some of it were true, you\\'d have to take\\nus for idiots for tolerating it.  And given that our insurance was\\ninstalled during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory\\ngovernments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still\\nchafing, they would\\'ve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix\\nthings ... think about it.

Kaliski Jr. \\\\\\\\\\n{\\\\tt burt@rsa.com} \\\\and\\nMatthew J.B. Robshaw \\\\\\\\\\n{\\\\tt matt@rsa.com} \\\\and\\nRSA Laboratories \\\\\\\\\\n100 Marine Parkway \\\\\\\\\\nRedwood City, CA  94065}\\n\\\\date{April 23, 1993}\\n\\n\\\\maketitle\\n\\nA message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a\\n``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the\\ndigest is easy, finding a message with a given\\ndigest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the\\nsame digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms\\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\\nauthentication.\\n\\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\\nRivest \\\\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\\\em proved}\\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\\n\\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\\\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\\ninternal compression function, which maps\\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \\na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\\nwould expect.\\n\\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\\nalways involve {\\\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\\n\\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\n\\n\\\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\n\\\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\n\\\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\n\\\\newblock In {\\\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\n\\\\newblock Preprint.\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\\nR.L.

       " (\"OFM Comments:\\n\\n\\nNo disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on.\\nBut Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  That's quite\\ndifferent from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the\\nusual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he\\ndoes. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of \\nLazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that\\na fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice\\nand isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good \\nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \\nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \\nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built\\non Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were\\nremoved, there would BE no foundation.  \\n\\nThat's basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians \\nthat DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God.\\nI cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if\\nmy response to God is motivated on fear.  \\n\\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\\n\\n-- \",\n",

I'd like to give some feedback based on\\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\\n\\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\\nwas another trap.  And there was!\\n\\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \\nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\\ntrap when there was none.\\n\\nI've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\\n\\n                                       -Barry\",\n",

Don\\'t tell me you don\\'t worship\\nOsiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson\\'s\\nEgyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British\\nMasonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black\\nmason.  I\\'ve talked with him, though much he likes to hide (\"mystery\"). \\nSpecial handshakes and all.

THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\\ndegree mason every learns of.\\nI haven\\'t read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\\napologist (can\\'t remember his name) on TV, didn\\'t exactly come to this same\\nconclusion.  \\n\\n\"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\\n-i.e. as a child in his mother\\'s arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

       " (\"\\nWhen kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection \\nincidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest \\nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \\nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \\nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\\n\\n\\nDaycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.\\n\\n\\nExposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses \\nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \\nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \\nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\\n\\n\\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \\nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \\nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \\nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \\nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\\n \\n\\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \\nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \\nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \\ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \\nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \\nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \\nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \\nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \\nassociated with the infection.\\n\\n\\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \\nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \\nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \\nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \\nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \\nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \\ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \\nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \\ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \\nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \\nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \\nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \\nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.\\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \\ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \\nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \\nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's \\nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \\nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \\nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \\nfor getting general dietary advice from however.\\n\",\n",
